# Classy-Fidelity - Day 1
A simple Class that extracts and plots data from your fidelity account, specifically your positions 

Have you ever try to decipher your stock performance in fidelity's landing page?, I know is not the nicest app, and probably one of the reasons why you switched to Robinhood, anyway, let's use this as a motivation for my first project, the objectives of this project (from a technical standpoint are the following):

1.- Object Oriented Programming - Creating a class that extracts data, creates a Dataframe, interrogates the Datafram and plot information
2.- DataFrames - To use pandas library, the defacto method for handiling DataFrames
3.- Matplotlib - Perhaps not the fastest library for plotting but certainly, a library widely use with Python

The 3 points above summarizes the tools that are essential for a Data Scientist/Analyst/AI practitioner, and this first Class summarizes the foundations of future endevours.

#How do I get data for to use the class?
- You need a Fidelity Account, and additionaly you need to purchase a couple of stocks 
- If you have a Fidelity Account, please Log-in
- On the main menu, click #Account Positions#
- Navigate your mouse to the right hand corner of the table containing all your positions, and click the incon that has an arrow pointing out.
- The CSV extract is the data you need in order to run this Class.
