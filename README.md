# Classy-Fidelity - Day 1
## OOP,Pandas & Matplotlib


A simple Class that extracts and plots data from your fidelity account, specifically your positions Have you ever try to decipher your stock performance in fidelity's landing page?, I know is not the nicest app, and probably one of the reasons why you switched to Robinhood, anyway, let's use this as a motivation for my first project, the objectives of this project (from a technical standpoint are the following):

- Object Oriented Programming - Creating a class that extracts data, creates a Dataframe, interrogates the Dataframe and plot data
- DataFrames - To use pandas library, the defacto method for handling DataFrames
- âœ¨MaMatplotlib erphaps not the fastest library for plotting but certainly, a library widely use with Python

The 3 points above summarizes the tools that are essential for a Data Scientist/Analyst/AI practitioner, and this first Class sets a solid foundation for future endeavours.
##  How do I get data for using this class?
 You need a Fidelity Account, and additionally you need to purchase a couple of stocks 
 
     - If you have a Fidelity Account (www.fidelity.com), please Log-in 
     - On the main menu, click [Account Positions]
     - Navigate your mouse to the right hand corner of the table containing all your positions, and click the incon that has an arrow pointing out.
    -  The CSV extract is the only data that you'll need in order to run this Class


## Instructions
1.- Clone the repository
2.- Please use Python3, upgrade if necessary
3.- Install pandas library, either using Anaconda or pip i.e === pip install pandas
4.- Install matplotlib library, either using Anaconda or pip i.e === pip install matplotlib

## Usage

1.- If you have a fidelity account, please ensure that you save your file inside the folder data, the script <run_positions.py> is setup with that structure
2.- If you don't have a fidelity account, don't worry about it, you should be using Robinhood anyway, in anycase I'm providing you with a portfolio so you can visualize the Class, and any feedback regarding the methods or my portfolio is certainly welcome.
3.- After moving your data in to the correct folder (as per point 1), please ensure that you change the .csv file name in the file run_positions.py (after data/) accordingly, see example below
```python
 file = "data/Portfolio_Positions_Feb-17-2021.csv"
```
4.- Please note that you don't have to edit the fidelity_class.py, the only file that you have to modify is run positions 
5.- Please run the following command on your terminal, and just ensure you are on the correct folder.
```python
python run_positions.py
```
# Methods
As you probably guessed, my idea is to create several classes as the foundation for a full on  library that will be use by a WebService for stock visualization/forecast for Fidelity/Robinhood datasets, so this is the first mile of a 1,000 miles trip - The methods available so far are the following:
1.-  Top Performer - The initial position from fidelity it's cluttered and doesn't tell you right away , which stock is your best performer
```python
portfolio.top_performer()
```
2.- Worst Performer - The initial position from fidelity is clutter and doesn't tell you right away, which stock is your worst performer
 ```python
portfolio.worst_performer()
```
3 graphs for your pleasure ; Current Total Value of your portfolio - Gain/Loss for the day - Net Profit Please note that the Net Profit is simply Current Portfolio Value - Initial Portfolio Value, it doesn't include your transaction fees or dividends</li>
```python
portfolio.plot_daily_performance()
#portfolio.plot_portfolio_performance()
#portfolio.plot_current_value()
```
Please remove the comments in order to plot the different graphs available, bear in mind that when you are using matplotlib (at least how I have structured my methods), you can only plot a single graph, there is a reason for that, in the future the graphs will be redirected to a webpage.
